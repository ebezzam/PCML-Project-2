# PCML-Project-2
MATLAB code and report for Project 2 for the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning course at EPFL (http://icapeople.epfl.ch/mekhan/pcml15.html). The goal of the project was to classify between Horse, Airplane, Car, and other.

1) Run the following functions in the PCA folder so the 5-fold training and testing data for binary and multi-class prediction are already computed for each of the models:

precomputeVectors_binary.m  // for classifying between horse/plane/car and others
precomputeVectors.m         // for classying between the four

2) To apply the following models for classification:

K-NN (k- nearest neighbors)
Neural Network
Random Forest
SVM

run the following script in the corresonding model's folder:

test_<MODEL>.m
